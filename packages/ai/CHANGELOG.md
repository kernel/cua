# Changelog

## 0.10.1 - 2026-08-06

- Add Anthropic's documented `computer_20251124` and `computer_20250124`
  declaration versions while retaining the existing early-access version.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-08-04

Breaking: upgrade `@earendil-works/pi-ai` to 0.83.0.

- Remove the local `claude-opus-5`, `gemini-3.6-flash`, and
  `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` model overrides: pi-ai 0.83.0's registry now carries
  all three with the same metadata. Overrides remain only for the CUA-only
  providers pi-ai does not ship (Meta, Tzafon, Yutori).
- Kimi K3 reasoning effort follows pi-ai's catalog metadata with no CUA
  override: `low`/`high`/`max` map through `thinkingLevelMap` (the rest clamp
  away), and requests carry `reasoning_effort` on Moonshot or OpenRouter's
  nested `reasoning.effort`.
- Disable Tzafon native non-screenshot action loops: its Responses API requires
  every `computer_call_output` to carry an image, while CUA returns screenshots
  only when explicitly requested. Unsupported native actions now fail before
  browser execution instead of entering a text-only loop that the API rejects.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-08-03

- Add Kimi K3 through OpenRouter as `openrouter:moonshotai/kimi-k3`,
  authenticated with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, while retaining direct Moonshot access
  through `moonshotai:kimi-k3`.
- Share Kimi K3's CUA capability metadata across both transports: nested browser
  schemas are accepted, the larger `browser_act` schema is rejected, and
  state-mutating function tools disable parallel calls.
- Resolve schema and tool-call compatibility from concrete model capabilities
  instead of provider-wide allowlists. Existing provider-family defaults are
  preserved, and provider-native tools remain restricted to their native
  transports.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-07-31

Breaking: agent tools are now one explicit, identity-keyed catalog. The mode,
implicit-tool, and runtime-spec APIs are removed.

- Add the frozen `cua` namespace with atomic browser/computer/Playwright tools,
  `browser`/`computer`/`mixed` convenience toolsets, mechanical batch tools,
  coordinate contracts, and provider-native tools/toolsets.
- Add `compileCuaToolCatalog()` with stable identities; exact requested-order
  preservation; schema/catalog fingerprints; exact and
  provider-normalized collision checks; model compatibility checks; inspectable
  declarations; dynamic-loading eligibility; generated header composition;
  ordered payload transforms; and incoming native-call plans.
- Catalog compilation is declaration-only and deterministic: it accepts CUA
  specs and sanitized caller `Tool` declarations plus a viewport, returns
  pi-ai `Tool` declarations (`catalog.toolDeclarations`) and provider plans,
  and never constructs executable tools or retains the requested inputs.
  `callerToolIdentity()` is the single canonical identity scheme for caller
  tools, shared with cua-agent and cua-cli. The package no longer depends on
  `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`; materialization and implementation identity
  live in `@onkernel/cua-agent`.
- Remove `resolveCuaRuntimeSpec`, `CuaRuntimeSpec`, `CuaMode`, mode inference,
  legacy native-tool switches, implicit navigation tools, and provider-owned
  default prompt selection from the public API.
- Provider-native declarations now compose by selected identity with ordinary
  functions. Add fixed-version Anthropic computer/browser factories, OpenAI
  native computer composition, Tzafon viewport-aware declaration replacement,
  Google's current predefined browser toolset, and identity-scoped Yutori
  native selection. Every provider surface exposes its first-party source.
- Add deterministic provider composition: generated model preparation, tool
  serialization, provider fields, then caller payload hooks.
  Header requirements merge without overwriting unrelated caller headers.
- Add a Google Interactions API adapter plus current `computer_use` browser
  action names and `[0, 999]` coordinates. Exact-subset declarations exclude
  every unselected current action, and excluded incoming calls fail with a
  named catalog error. Support the documented `gemini-3.6-flash`,
  `gemini-3.5-flash`, and `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` models.
- Add `anthropic:claude-opus-5` with its 1M-token context window, 128k output
  limit, adaptive thinking levels, and July 2026 native-tool compatibility.
  Native `browser_20260701` transparently retries through an equivalent
  function-tool declaration when the active credential lacks beta access.
- Add the verified `openai:gpt-5.6-sol` model.
- Expose Google's predefined actions through `browser()` only. Remove legacy
  Google actions and the Meta/xAI/Moonshot coordinate toolsets; those
  custom-function providers use the standard CUA browser toolset.
- Validate large function schemas separately from ordinary nested schemas.
  Moonshot retains CUA browser primitives and `browser_wait_for`, but catalog
  compilation now rejects `browser_act`, whose larger schema its API refuses.
- Native tool execution metadata carries stop-on-first-failure policy without
  introducing provider branches in cua-agent.
- Declare `engines.node` `>=22.19.0`. This is not a new requirement: every
  `@earendil-works/pi-*` dependency already declares the same floor, so it was
  previously enforced only transitively and never stated on this package.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-07-17

- Added Moonshot Kimi K3 computer-use support: `moonshotai:kimi-k3`
  (`moonshot:` accepted as a ref alias), authenticated with
  `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`. Kimi streams through the OpenAI-compatible chat
  completions transport with ordinary function tools.
- New `moonshot` provider namespace following the standard conventions
  (`computerTools`, `coordinateSystem`, `buildMoonshotSystemPrompt`,
  `providerModule`, …). Kimi's coordinate contract is normalized 0–1
  width/height fractions, matching the model's native visual grounding;
  payload middleware disables parallel tool calls.
- Bumped `@earendil-works/pi-ai` to 0.80.10 (carries the Kimi K3 registry
  entry). Grok 4.5's registry api id is now `openai-responses`; CUA routing
  behavior is unchanged.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-07-10

Breaking: response threading is now configured per request instead of through
`CUA_DISABLE_RESPONSE_THREADING`.

- `CuaSimpleStreamOptions` now includes `disableResponseThreading`, allowing
  OpenAI and Tzafon Responses API calls to send the complete current context
  instead of continuing through `previous_response_id`.
- Removed the process-wide `CUA_DISABLE_RESPONSE_THREADING` environment
  variable. `@onkernel/cua-agent` users can set `responseThreading: false` on
  `CuaAgent` or `CuaAgentHarness`; lower-level callers can pass
  `disableResponseThreading: true` in stream options.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-07-09

Introduces action planes (modes) and Anthropic native computer-use tools.

- New `mode` option (`"computer"` | `"browser"` | `"hybrid"`, exported as
  `CuaMode`) on `resolveCuaRuntimeSpec`, `computerTools`, and the executor
  builders selects which action plane(s) the model sees. `computer` is the
  pre-modes default and stays byte-compatible. `browser` exposes the new
  browser-plane canonical actions; `hybrid` exposes both planes deduplicated
  to one tool per capability, with browser actions restricted to element refs
  so the OS screenshot is the single coordinate frame.
- New browser-plane canonical actions (`CUA_BROWSER_ACTION_TYPES`):
  `browser_snapshot`, `browser_find`, `browser_text`, `browser_click`,
  `browser_fill`, `browser_scroll_to`, `browser_navigate`,
  `browser_list_tabs`, `browser_new_tab`, `browser_screenshot`,
  `browser_evaluate`, and friends, with per-mode tool naming
  (`cuaToolNameForAction`), descriptions, schemas, and system prompts.
- New `nativeTool` option drives Anthropic models through their native
  computer-use declarations: `computer_20260701` (computer mode, with
  `enable_zoom`) behind `anthropic-beta: computer-use-2026-07-01`, and
  `browser_20260701` (browser mode) behind
  `anthropic-beta: browser-use-2026-07-01`.
- JavaScript execution is on by default: `browser_evaluate` is part of the
  default browser/hybrid action sets, and native `browser_20260701`
  declarations default `enable_javascript_exec` to true (an explicit value on
  the spec wins). Opt out by passing an explicit `actions` list or native
  tool spec.
- New `zoom` computer action (cropped display inspection).

## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-07

Breaking: adopts pi-ai 0.80's instance-based `Models` API and drops the
global api-registry surface.

- Requests now stream through a pi `Models` collection. New exports:
  `createCuaModels(options?)` builds a collection with pi's builtin providers
  plus CUA's adjustments (OpenAI routed through `openai-cua-responses`,
  Google accepting `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`, Tzafon and Yutori
  registered); `cuaModels()` returns the shared default collection.
- Removed `registerCuaProviders()` and the import-time registration side
  effect. Build a collection with `createCuaModels()` instead; nothing global
  is mutated.
- The pi-ai re-export now follows pi-ai 0.80: the free functions `complete`,
  `stream`, `completeSimple`, `streamSimple`, `getModel`, `getModels`, and
  the api-registry (`registerApiProvider`, `getApiProvider`,
  `resetApiProviders`, …) are gone. Call the equivalent methods on
  `cuaModels()`.
- API keys resolve from the documented env-var convention through provider
  auth when streaming via the collection; explicit `apiKey` stream options
  still take precedence.
- Removed the `claude-sonnet-5` and `gpt-5.5` model overrides (pi-ai 0.80's
  registry carries both) and the `gpt-5.5-2026-04-23` dated-snapshot
  override. Dated snapshot refs no longer resolve — use the family id
  (`openai:gpt-5.5`).
- Updated `@earendil-works/pi-ai` to 0.80.3.

## 0.3.4 - 2026-06-30

- Adapt newer Anthropic models to the adaptive thinking payload format, including `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-opus-4-8`, and `claude-opus-4-7`.

## 0.3.3 - 2026-06-30

- Add computer-use support for the `claude-sonnet-5` Anthropic model.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-06-24

- Add computer-use support for the `gemini-3.5-flash` Google model.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-06-23

- Add the `playwright_execute` tool definition: `CuaPlaywrightSchema`,
  `CUA_PLAYWRIGHT_TOOL_NAME`, `CUA_PLAYWRIGHT_TOOL_DESCRIPTION`,
  `createCuaPlaywrightToolDefinition()`, and the `CuaPlaywrightInput` type.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-06-12

- Add `CuaSimpleStreamOptions`: pi-ai `SimpleStreamOptions` plus the
  `keepToolNames` extension the Yutori/Tzafon stream adapters consume, so
  callers can pass it through `streamSimple` without a cast.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-06-11

- Add computer-use support for `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, `tzafon.northstar-cua-fast-1.6`, and `tzafon.northstar-cua-fast-1.7-experiment`.
- Drop `gemini-3-pro-preview`, which Google has retired (the API now returns 404 for it).

## 0.2.1 - 2026-06-11

- Add computer-use support for the `claude-fable-5` Anthropic model.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- The published package is now importable under plain Node ESM. 0.1.0 shipped
  extensionless relative imports in `dist/`, so `import "@onkernel/cua-ai"`
  failed outside bundlers; `dist/` is now bundled with tsdown.
- The shipped `examples/quickstart.ts` imports `@onkernel/cua-ai` instead of a
  `../src` path that does not exist in the tarball, checks `stopReason` so
  provider errors are no longer silent, resolves its API key via
  `requireCuaEnvApiKeyForModel`, and switches providers with the `CUA_MODEL`
  env var.
- `docs/` (the supported-models list the README links to) is now included in
  the npm tarball.
- A malformed Yutori tool call now degrades to an empty-arguments call instead
  of failing the entire response, matching the existing Tzafon hardening.

### Breaking changes

- Provider namespaces follow one convention. Every namespace now exports
  `computerTools({ actions? })` / `computerToolExecutors({ actions? })`,
  `createActionSchema`, `coordinateSystem()`, `providerModule`,
  `<PROVIDER>_CUA_ACTION_TYPES`, `<PROVIDER>_COMPUTER_INSTRUCTIONS`, a
  `<Provider>Action` type, and `ComputerToolsOptions`. This replaces 0.1.0's
  `createComputerToolDefinitions(options)` /
  `CreateComputerToolDefinitionsOptions`, the per-namespace
  `COMPUTER_TOOL_COORDINATES` constants, `TZAFON_ACTION_TYPES` /
  `YUTORI_ACTION_TYPES`, and the `OPENAI_BATCH_INSTRUCTIONS` /
  `GEMINI_INSTRUCTIONS_RAW` / `TZAFON_INSTRUCTIONS_RAW` /
  `YUTORI_INSTRUCTIONS_RAW` prompt constants.
- `CUA_BATCH_TOOL_NAME` is now `"computer_batch"` (was
  `"batch_computer_actions"`), matching the batch tool Anthropic ships by
  default. `anthropic.ANTHROPIC_BATCH_TOOL_NAME` carries the same new value;
  the other per-namespace batch aliases (`TZAFON_BATCH_TOOL_NAME`,
  `YUTORI_BATCH_TOOL_NAME`, `*_BATCH_DESCRIPTION`, `*BatchSchema`,
  `*BatchInput`) were removed — use `CUA_BATCH_TOOL_NAME`,
  `CUA_BATCH_TOOL_DESCRIPTION`, `CuaBatchSchema`, and `CuaBatchInput`.
- Anthropic tools are now the 13 canonical browser actions Anthropic supports
  (no `back`/`forward`/`url`) plus a `computer_batch` batch tool by default;
  pass `excludeBatch: true` to omit it. Unsupported `actions` entries throw.
  `anthropic.ANTHROPIC_CUA_ACTION_TYPES` reflects the supported subset rather
  than aliasing the full canonical list.
- Yutori models now use Yutori's documented native `tool_set` request field.
  `streamYutori` strips canonical action tools from the outbound payload
  (preserve specific tools via the `keepToolNames` stream option), selects the
  n1.5 core tool set where applicable, and normalizes native tool calls back
  to canonical names. `yutori.providerModule.toolDefinitions()` is `[]`;
  `yutori.computerTools()` builds local mirrors for executor lookup, validates
  `{ actions }` against the supported subset, and throws on unsupported
  actions. `yutoriBuiltinToolsOnPayload` was replaced by
  `yutoriNativeToolSetOnPayload`. The Yutori runtime spec also carries a
  screenshot policy (append a 1280x800 webp screenshot to the latest message).
- Family model annotations now match only the family root plus numeric
  revision or dated-snapshot suffixes (`claude-opus-4-7`,
  `gpt-5.5-2026-04-23`). Named sibling variants such as `gpt-5.4-mini` are no
  longer listed by `listCuaModels()` or accepted by `getCuaModel()` without
  their own annotation.
- `google:gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025` was removed from the
  catalog: it rejects the standard function declarations this package sends
  and requires Google's native `tools.computer_use` wrapper. Use
  `google:gemini-3-flash-preview` or `google:gemini-3-pro-preview`.
- `streamTzafonResponses` no longer accepts a `maxOutputTokens` option — use
  the standard `maxTokens` stream option.

### Added

- `CuaProviderModule` contract plus a `providerModule` export per namespace,
  and a richer `CuaRuntimeSpec`: `toolExecutors` (local adapters that turn
  provider tool calls into canonical `CuaAction`s via `CuaToolExecutorSpec`),
  `coordinateSystem`, and optional `screenshot` policy alongside the existing
  tool definitions, default prompt, and payload middleware.
- `resolveCuaRuntimeSpec(input, options?)` accepts `ComputerToolsOptions` and
  forwards it to the provider module, so runtime consumers can narrow tool
  definitions and executors (e.g. `{ actions: ["click"] }`).
- `registerCuaProviders()` is exported: importing the package still registers
  the Yutori/Tzafon stream providers automatically, and this restores them
  after pi-ai registry mutators (`clearApiProviders`, `resetApiProviders`,
  `unregisterApiProviders`).
- `parseCuaModelRef` / `getCuaModel` accept `"gemini:"` refs as an alias for
  `"google:"`, and unsupported-provider errors now list the valid providers.
- `CuaMouseButton` and `CuaDragMouseButton` closed unions type the `button`
  field on click/mouse_down/mouse_up and drag actions.
- `yutori.YutoriOptions` and `tzafon.TzafonResponsesOptions` are exported and
  aligned; both support `keepToolNames` to preserve caller tools that collide
  with canonical action names on the wire.
- Yutori native action vocabulary exports: `YUTORI_N1_ACTION_TYPES`,
  `YUTORI_N15_CORE_ACTION_TYPES`, `YUTORI_N15_EXPANDED_ACTION_TYPES`,
  tool-set ids, `yutoriToolSetForModel`, `yutoriNativeActionsForModel`, and
  `toCanonicalActions`; Tzafon exports `toCanonicalActions`,
  `TzafonCanonicalAction`, `tzafonComputerUseOnPayload`, and
  `tzafonToolCallId`.
- README and JSDoc coverage across the public surface: API key prerequisites
  and helpers, error handling (`stopReason` semantics), a multi-turn
  tool-result example, the complete export list, and per-provider canonical
  action subsets.

## 0.1.0

- Provider-qualified CUA model catalog with support annotations and curated overrides.
- Unified runtime-spec resolution for provider defaults (tools, prompts, payload middleware).
- Registers CUA provider adapters and exports canonical computer-use schemas/tool definitions.
