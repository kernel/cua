# `@onkernel/cua-agent`

Kernel browser computer-use classes built on the `Agent` and `AgentHarness`
classes from [`@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-agent-core).
The full pi-agent-core surface is re-exported from this package, including
`NodeExecutionEnv` from its `/node` subpath.

This package keeps pi agent semantics intact and adds browser execution
plumbing for canonical CUA tools.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @onkernel/cua-agent @onkernel/cua-ai @onkernel/sdk
```

## Quick Start (`CuaAgent`)

```ts
import Kernel from "@onkernel/sdk";
import { CuaAgent } from "@onkernel/cua-agent";

const client = new Kernel({ apiKey: process.env.KERNEL_API_KEY! });
const browser = await client.browsers.create({ stealth: true });

const agent = new CuaAgent({
  browser,
  client,
  initialState: {
    model: "openai:gpt-5.5",
    systemPrompt: "You are a careful browser automation agent.",
  },
});

await agent.prompt("Open news.ycombinator.com and summarize the top story.");
```

## Quick Start (`CuaAgentHarness`)

`prompt()` returns the turn's final assistant message, and every turn is
persisted to the session — later prompts see the full transcript. Runtime
config like the model can change between turns (or even mid-turn, applying at
the next provider request):

```ts
import { CuaAgentHarness, InMemorySessionRepo, NodeExecutionEnv } from "@onkernel/cua-agent";
import type { AssistantMessage } from "@onkernel/cua-ai";

const sessionRepo = new InMemorySessionRepo();
const session = await sessionRepo.create({ id: "research" });

const harness = new CuaAgentHarness({
  browser,
  client,
  env: new NodeExecutionEnv({ cwd: process.cwd() }),
  model: "openai:gpt-5.5",
  session,
});

const textOf = (message: AssistantMessage) =>
  message.content.flatMap((block) => (block.type === "text" ? [block.text] : [])).join("").trim();

// Turn 1: a session-backed prompt.
const first = await harness.prompt("Open example.com and describe what you see.");
console.log(textOf(first));

// Swap providers mid-session; CUA tools and the default prompt refresh to match.
await harness.setModel("anthropic:claude-opus-4-7");

// Turn 2 continues the same transcript on the new model.
const second = await harness.prompt("Open the most relevant link from what you found.");
console.log(textOf(second));
```

While a turn is running, `steer()` injects course corrections, `followUp()`
queues the next instruction, and `subscribe()` streams the underlying agent
events. `compact()` and session branching are available for long-running
transcripts — see the pi-agent-core docs for the full harness lifecycle.

Use `CuaAgent` when you want direct pi `Agent` control: raw message state,
lifecycle events, custom streaming, and explicit prompt/continue/queue control.
Reach for the harness shape when you want an app layer around the loop:
session-backed turns, resource and prompt entry points, provider/auth hooks,
active tool selection, compaction/tree workflows, and higher-level queue events.
`CuaAgentHarness` extends pi `AgentHarness`, installs CUA defaults, and refreshes
provider-specific runtime state when `setModel()` changes models.

## Core Concepts

### Class-First API

- `CuaAgent extends Agent`
- `CuaAgentHarness extends AgentHarness`

Both classes mirror pi constructor shapes and behavior, with minimal additions:
- `browser` (Kernel browser response)
- `client` (Kernel SDK client)
- CUA model refs (`"provider:model"`) accepted where pi expects a concrete model
- `extraTools` to add your own pi tools alongside the built-in browser tools
- `computerUseExtra: true` to let the model use a small navigation helper
- `playwright: true` to let the model run Playwright/TypeScript against the
  live browser session

If auth callbacks are omitted, both classes default to CUA env var conventions:
- OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Anthropic: `ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Gemini: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- OpenRouter: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- Tzafon: `TZAFON_API_KEY`
- Yutori: `YUTORI_API_KEY`

### Tool Defaults

By default, the classes install provider-selected CUA computer tool executors
from `@onkernel/cua-ai`. Each provider decides which tool names the model sees;
the matching executor adapter translates returned tool calls into canonical CUA
actions that run against the Kernel browser.

Use `extraTools` to add your own pi tools alongside the provider's
computer-use tools. This is useful when the model needs to call
application-specific code, such as looking up a record, writing a database row,
or handing off to another service while it also controls the browser.

Not every provider's native computer-use vocabulary includes browser
navigation — some models can click and type but have no direct way to open a
URL or go back. `computerUseExtra: true` adds `computer_use_extra`, a
provider-neutral escape hatch exposing `goto`, `back`, `forward`, and `url`
so navigation works uniformly regardless of which model is driving.

Some steps are awkward as raw pointer/keyboard actions: precise DOM reads,
form fills, data extraction, or waiting on a specific selector.
`playwright: true` adds `playwright_execute`, which runs Playwright/TypeScript
directly against the live browser session. `page`, `context`, and `browser`
are in scope and the code may `return` a JSON-serializable value. Each call
runs in a fresh JS context (locals don't persist across calls) but the
browser session does carry over. No screenshot is returned automatically;
request one on a follow-up turn when the model needs to see the page.
Playwright-level failures come back as tool content (so the model can adapt)
rather than thrown errors. Verified e2e
against Anthropic, Tzafon, and Yutori CUA models; OpenAI and Google are
unit-tested.

### Model Switching

`CuaAgent` follows pi `Agent` semantics: assign `agent.state.model` to a
concrete model or CUA model ref. CUA-owned tools and the default system prompt
refresh with the new provider runtime.

`CuaAgentHarness` follows pi `AgentHarness` semantics: call
`await harness.setModel(model)`. The harness updates its model through pi's
snapshot machinery and refreshes CUA-owned tools and default prompt state for
the next provider request.

### Tool Composition

Use `createCuaComputerTools()` to compose your own tool list from provider
execution adapters:

```ts
import { resolveCuaRuntimeSpec } from "@onkernel/cua-ai";
import { createCuaComputerTools } from "@onkernel/cua-agent";

const runtime = resolveCuaRuntimeSpec("openai:gpt-5.5");
const tools = [
  ...createCuaComputerTools({
    browser,
    client,
    toolExecutors: runtime.toolExecutors,
  }),
  myCustomTool,
];
```
