# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-13

- Adds `CuaAgentHarness`, a provider-aware harness API with session-backed turns, resource and prompt helpers, active tool selection, and model switching.
- Keeps CUA runtime defaults in sync when changing models so provider-specific tools, prompts, and payload middleware update together.
- Improves browser keyboard shortcut translation for Kernel computer actions.

## 0.1.0

- Class-first CUA runtime: `CuaAgent` and `CuaHarness` on top of pi-agent-core.
- Provider-neutral browser tool executors for canonical CUA tool names, backed by Kernel browser actions.
- Includes examples plus unit and live e2e coverage for common provider/model combinations.
