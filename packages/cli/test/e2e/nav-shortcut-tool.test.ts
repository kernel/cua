/**
 * End-to-end self-improve loop driven directly against HarnessExtensionHost
 * (the cua CLI runtime does not wire the host yet, so the host is exercised here
 * the same way the runtime eventually will), with no real browser or LLM.
 *
 * The loop being proven:
 *   RUN 1  an agent drills into a deep settings page the slow way — goto the
 *          site root, then a menu/submenu/settings click chain (4 base tool
 *          executions).
 *   ->     a meta-agent distills the section -> deep-URL mapping it observed and
 *          authors the `open_section` learned tool (the fixture committed
 *          alongside this test).
 *   ->     host.reload() picks the new extension up from disk.
 *   RUN 2  one `open_section` call resolves the section to its deep URL and
 *          returns the single-navigation plan (1 tool execution).
 *
 * Host APIs under stress: load/reload, reapplyTools (the learned tool ends up
 * both registered and active after reload), and the bridge forwarding
 * `tool_execution_end` with the tool's `details` intact.
