/**
 * End-to-end self-improve loop for HarnessExtensionHost: a computer-use agent
 * paginates a list inefficiently, a meta-agent authors a learned tool as a pi
 * extension, the host reloads it, and the next run resolves the whole list in
 * one call to the learned tool.
 *
 * What this scenario proves beyond the basic loop: the learned tool keeps an
 * `agent_start`-incremented run counter and reports it in its result, so the
 * test observes that the host re-binds an extension's `pi.on` handlers after
 * reload — the bridge re-delivers `agent_start` to the freshly-imported
 * extension on the second run.
 *
 * The learned tool also de-duplicates items across page boundaries, which is the
 * concrete inefficiency the pixel agent had: it screenshotted each page and
 * re-read the rows overlapping the previous page, double-counting them.
 *
 * The fake harness is built without `playwright: true` and its Kernel client has
 * no daemon, so the learned tool operates as pure JS over an `html` parameter
 * that stands in for the page markup the agent would otherwise stitch together
 * across screenshots. The mechanism under test is the host loop, not a browser.
